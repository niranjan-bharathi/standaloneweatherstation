## Resources to learn from

Meteorology is a wide field and strongly overlaps with other fields of study and experimentation. Learning it thus, actually helps us learn every wider edges of science. Constructing a weather station can be interpretated as a fun project for the weekend, but also on serious note can be extended in to amateur level, and pro-level - all beginning humbly from fun. :)

Learning about meteorology can come from professional degree that helps us understand its theoretical vocabulary, jargons, terms, definitions - which may or may not be useful in real life. However, duh !. We have internet. We have people like us everywhere in the planet and most of the are connected. Since it requires more time and resource to individually gain the same knowledge again and again we can aggreagate and compose such resources here - atleast to a extent that helps us understand meterology.



## Institutes, Programmes:

Publicly funded institutes - government run have a significant impact in Meteorological research at all levels of governance. Certainly when x% of a countries economy is influenced by Climatic conditions - there is no way to run way from it. Nature wins.

## Guides, Books:

Guides formed by the organizations - for several different purposes helps us to udnerstand better about Meteorology and weather station instrument further.

## Standards, Formats:

Some open standards need to be adopted when constructing a weather station to make it generic and universal in adaptation.

* [SYNOP codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYNOP)
* [METAR codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/METAR)
* [CLIMAT codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLIMAT)



## Collaboration & Communities:

With the rise in Citizen Science, Commons Based Peer Production the participation in Science has increased multifold and organically started to create complex networks which continuously consume data, process them, report and visualize back to the people itself - which is - the far more near ideal scenario of democracy practice globally. However, more people need to be part of the network through volunteering.
